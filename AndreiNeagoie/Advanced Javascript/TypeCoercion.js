// Type coercion means that when the opperants (left and right of operator (=)) are different types one of them will be converted into an equivilant value.
// eg. 
1 == '1'

// type coercion happens when you use the double equal ( == ).
// It means compare the two values and if their types are different coerce them into the same type

// === means compare two values but don't try and change their types, be explicit
