AJAX allows webpage's and webapps to change content dynamically.

fetch()

promise is saying that fetch is making a request somewhere on the internet and it 'promises' to let you know when the value is returned.
to access promises you use '.then()'
fetch(URL).then(response => console.log(response))
fetch(URL).then(response => response.json())  ----- Adding the .json converts it into readable but we just get the promise now
fetch(URL).then(response => response.json()).then(data => console.log(data)); ---- adding the then allows us to access the promised data
