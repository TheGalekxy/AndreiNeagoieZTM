Relational Databases
-they all follow the same standard format
    -two or more tables with columns and rows
    -the relationship between tables is called a schema
    -in a Relational database the schema must be clearly defined before any info can be added
    -username in the "tweets table" is the foreign key of the username in the "users table" **** FROM VIDEO ****
    -primary key: are the labels of identification in each table
-all relational databases use SQL, which allows us to communicate with the database

NoSQL / Non Relation Database
-lets you build an application without having to define a schema first
-if your data requirements arent clear at the outset of your project then it would be better to go with a non relational database, a greater flexibility
-mongoDB is Document Oriented: it stores information as Documents*******

Databases are specific to your personal needs. For example, if you needed to find the average size of a tweet then a relational DB would be better because all the tweets are stored together, whereas in the non-relational they are split up into different files.
