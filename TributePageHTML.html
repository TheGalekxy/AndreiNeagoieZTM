          <h3>The criminal who owned the Toronto Maple Leafs for Decades</h3>
          <p>
            Ballard was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1903.<br>
            In 1961, Ballard was part of a sale by Conn Smythe in which he became a part owner of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. <br>
            He played a key role in the Leaf dynasty of the 1960's but would soon display character traits that would make him one of the most detested owners in NHL history. <br>
            In 1969, Ballard was charged with tex evasion and were accused of using Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for his personal expenses. <br>
            Eventually Ballard became the sole owner of Maple Leafs Ltd. and brought about a new era for the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club. <br>
            Under his ownership, the Maple Leafs saw unrivalled futility and hardship.
